# Customer Segmentation Using Python and Machine Learning 

## Overview
This project applies **customer segmentation** using **Python and machine learning** on the **Walmart dataset**. We use **K-Means clustering and RFM analysis** to classify customers into segments based on their purchasing behavior. To understand more about customer segmentation you can read my blog.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/walmart-sales-dataset)

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and encoding data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding customer demographics and spending patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering (RFM Analysis)** – Creating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
4. **Applying K-Means Clustering** – Using the Elbow Method and silhouette score to find the optimal number of clusters.
5. **Business Insights & Recommendations** – Interpreting clusters for targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Findings
- Customers were successfully segmented into **three groups** based on purchasing behavior.
- **Cluster 0 (Low-Value Customers):** Rare shoppers with low spending.
- **Cluster 1 (Moderate-Value Customers):** Regular buyers with moderate spending.
- **Cluster 2 (High-Value Customers):** Loyal and high-spending customers.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)
